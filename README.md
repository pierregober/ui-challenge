Design inspiration from https://movies.disney.com/a-z

#### Start app

`npm i`
`npm run dev`

or

https://disney-ui-challenge.netlify.app

#### Definites

- [x] Create a 'home' page displaying all available movies.
- [x] Create a 'Movie Detail' page dedicated to an individual movie. This would be accessed by clicking into a movie from the home page.
- [x] Style the pages in whatever way you feel comfortable.

#### Bonus points

- [x] Make the home page sortable (by Name / Date, ascending / descending)
- [x] Add a Search Bar to return only movies whose title contains a search term
- [x] Plan for a large number of movies on the home page - using pagination, infinite scrolling, lazy loading, etc.

#### Extra points that I put in

- [x] Save the user settings for sort criteria in localStorage
- [x] Create a error page for movies that movies that aren't found
- [x] Add metadata for the favicon, and title
- [x] Add Skeletons to movie home page cards
